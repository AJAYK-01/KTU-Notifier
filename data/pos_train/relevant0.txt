Regarding the supplementary UG and PG exams scheduled to conduct during September / October 2020 for which registration is already opened students can apply through the portal and pay the fee at College office upto 19.08.2020 Wednesday. Last date for Colleges to submit the request to University will be 21.08.2020 Friday.
