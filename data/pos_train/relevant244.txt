 It is observed that few colleges have not yet submitted the eligibility details of students and Examination registrations of May 2020 lower semester examinations. Due to this issue, the result processing of lower semesters is getting delayed. Details of shortages are intimated and communicated to the Heads of Institutions. However, few Institutions are yet to upload student details even now. Hence, all Institutions are requested to complete the pending action(s) through portal on or before 6PM today itself. Once these details are updated, the result processing will be initiated within no time and results will be published without any further delay.
