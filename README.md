## Instructions to create your own version of this bot

- Clone the Repo.
- Install the requirements.txt using pip.
- Create a new Telegram Bot using BotFather in telegram.
- Create a Firebase Realtime Database for handling subscribers and storing notifications cache.
- Make a file named .env in the root folder and add the line TOKEN=XXXXXX (Your telegram bot token).
- Also add the firebase credentials to the .env file.
- Run bot.py in your system and you'll see that the bot starts responding to commands on Telegram.
- Your bot should work as long as you have bot.py running.
- You can host it to Heroku to run forever using instructions at https://github.com/michaelkrukov/heroku-python-script.
